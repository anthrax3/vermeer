          <p>I'm always searching for BBC history documentaries on YouTube and one day in 2015 landed on one by Adrew Gahram Dixon on Vermeer in his series <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-xGKQVrBdA" target="_blank"><em>The Secret Lives of Artists</em></a>. I was drawn to Vermeer's story and it was my first real exposure to much of his work. I really like the calm and the architectural quality of his work. I watched and read more on him and as I was going to Amsterdam a month or so later I decided I'd surely visit the Rijksmuseum and see some of Vermeers work first-hand.</p>

          <p>Seeing them first hand really sealed the deal for me. I loved going to a museum on my own, having a reason to push all the other work aside and sit and think about a few paintings. Because his known work is so limited it's very possible to see all of the Vermeers. I decided that I would. Details about each successive visit to see his work can be found on the <a href="visits.html">visits page</a>.</p>

          <p>I'm lucky in that my work and life allows me to travel and within a year I have seen two thirds of his work. You can see my progress on the <a href="stats.html">stats page</a>.</p>

          <p>Finally, much of my visits and information has been fueled by the detailed-beyond-belief site, <a href="" target="_blank">Essential Vermeer</a>. I've read and enjoyed the following books: <a href="">one</a>.
