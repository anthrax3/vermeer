            <p><b>Three Vermeers are in the <a href="https://www.mauritshuis.nl/en" target="_blank">Mauritshuis</a> in The Hague, Netherlands. I got there by train from Amsterdam.</b></p>
            <h4>Train</h4>
            <p>I took the train from the Central station in Amsterdam. There are ticket machines for the national rail service and it’s fairly easy to select a ticket from there to the central station in The Hague with a return at anytime later the same day. There are many trips a day between the two cities.</p>
            <p>The train ride is about 50 minutes; you pass through a few towns and on my trip I happened to see some tulip fields.</p>
            <h4>Mauritshuis</h4>
            <p>Once you’re in The Hague it’s about a 10m minute walk from the central station to the Mauritshuis. The museum is small so it is easy to see it all in one visit. The Vermeers are in the same square room with a central round seat in the middle for viewing.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="most divider-line">
            <p><b>Two Vermeers are in the <a href="http://www.skd.museum/en/museen-institutionen/zwinger-mit-semperbau/gemaeldegalerie-alte-meister/" target="_blank">Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister</a> in Dressden, Germany. I got there by train from Berlin.</b></p>
            <h4>Train</h4>
            <p>I bought train tickets from Berlin to Dresden from the <a href="https://www.bahn.com" target="_blank">DB Bahn</a>, the national rail, website. I took a cab to the station in the morning, but it's possible I was actually walking-distance from another Berlin station.</p>
            <p>The train ride is nice and about two hours. Seats are first-come-first-serve so if you're traveling with someone either get on the train early or pay to reserve seats together.</p>
            <h4>Gemäldegalerie</h4>
            <p>It's an easy walk from the Dresden train station to the museum. We went on a Saturday and there was fantastic marketing in the old city square. We had hotdogs, ice cream and beer—I even saw a real life May pole!</p>
            <p>The museum is a part of an old, beautiful palace. It's not so big but not so small, either. It would take a few hours to see all of it. The Veermeers are on the same floor but in different rooms. You'll need to check your bag in a locker for a Euro.</p>

            <h4>Gemäldegalerie</h4>
            <p>The museum is a part of a larger complex of galleries. It would be very easy to see all of this gallery in one visit. The Vermeers are in the same room. You'll need to check your bag in a locker for a Euro.</p>

            <p><b>Three Vermeers are in the <a href="http://rijksmuseum.nl" target="_blank">Rijksmuseum</a> in Amsterdam. I have visited twice while in Amsterdam and walked to the museum.</b><p>
            <h4>Rijksmuseum</h4>
            <p>At my first visit one painting was on loan to an exhibition in the States. At my second visit a different painting, Little Street, was on loan, but the previously loaned painting was back so I was able to see all that are in collection.</p>

            <p>The museum is large and wonderful and well worth a longer visit to see more of the collection.</p>
